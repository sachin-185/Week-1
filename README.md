# Week-1
This project implements a Smart Irrigation System powered by an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to automate water supply decisions based on real-time environmental conditions. The model is trained using data from key parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, helping farmers optimize irrigation schedules and conserve water.
