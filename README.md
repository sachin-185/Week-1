# 🌱 Smart Irrigation System (Week-1)

This project implements a **Smart Irrigation System** using **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** to automate water supply decisions based on real-time environmental conditions. The model is trained using dataset, helping farmers optimize irrigation schedules and conserve water.

---

## 📊 Model Training Summary

- The ANN model was trained over **20 epochs**.
- Initial accuracy: **64%**
- Final training accuracy: **94%**
- Final test accuracy: **87%**

These results show the model successfully **learned** from the data and can **generalize well** to unseen inputs.

---

## 🔍 How It Works

By analyzing input data (e.g., soil moisture, temperature, and humidity), the trained ANN predicts:

- `1` → **Irrigation needed**
- `0` → **No irrigation needed**

This helps ensure:
- ✅ **Efficient water usage**
- ✅ **Reduced manual labor**
- ✅ **Sustainable farming practices**

## ✅ Key Features

- 🌐 **Binary classification** using ANN
- 🌾 Trained on **sensor data**: moisture, temperature, humidity
- 📈 High model accuracy: **94% (train)** | **87% (test)**
- 💧 Automates irrigation decisions to **save water**
